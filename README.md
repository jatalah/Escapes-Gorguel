**ABSTRACT**

Fish escapes are a significant problem for the marine fish farming industry because of the associated ecological and socio-economic risks. Farm sabotage, although not the leading cause of fish escapes, is responsible for massive escape events in many world farming regions. Because of the large scale and intensity of the resulting escapes, sabotage has the potential for drastic ecological and socio-economic consequences. However, no study has described the fate of escapees after such events. This paper focuses on the persistence, spread and changes in the size distribution of farmed Mediterranean seabass escapees after a large-scale escape event caused by farm sabotage. We monitored the escapee density and size structure over three months after the escape at increasing distances from the escape point. Our analysis showed that fish rapidly dispersed from the escape point. We estimated that fish density decreased by 17% for every km away from the escape location, and it fell to 2% and 1% after one and two months of the escape event. The rapid spread of escaped farmed seabass demonstrates the need for a well-coordinated response plan that focuses fishing efforts in the coastal areas near the escape location (\<20 km) within the first 24 hours. The results of this study can be used to inform contingency plans and mitigate the socio-environmental risks associated with fish escape events caused by farm sabotage or other reasons. Our findings also emphasize the need to implement best practices in fish farm management to reduce the frequency and magnitude of escape events, including using secure containment systems, monitoring, and maintaining farm infrastructure.
