**ABSTRACT**

Farm sabotage can cause massive fish escape events that pose significant ecological and socio-economic risks. This study examined the fate of Mediterranean seabass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) escapees following a large-scale escape event caused by sabotage in the Alboran, Western Mediterranean Sea. We monitored the escapee density and size structure over three months after the escape at increasing distances from the escape point, up to 45 km away. Fish density adjacent to the escape location five days after the sabotage was on average 114 ± (44.7 S.E.) fish per 100 m2. Our analyses showed that fish quickly dispersed from the escape point, with a 17% decrease in density for every km away from the location and dropping to 2% and 1% after one and two months following the escape event. As escapee density declined throughout time and space, so did the size distribution, evident as a shift towards larger sizes. The rapid spread of escapees highlights the need for effective contingency plans focusing on fishing efforts in the coastal areas near the escape location (<20 km) within the first 24 hours. These results are paramount to mitigating the risks associated with escape events in a more cost-effective way. We emphasise the importance of effective sabotage prevention measures, such as security systems that can quickly detect intruders and trigger an immediate response to deter them. Additionally, enforcing appropriate sanctions based on the severity of the damage caused can help to discourage future sabotage attempts.
