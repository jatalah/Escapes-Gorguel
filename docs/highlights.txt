Farm sabotage causing fish escapes poses significant ecological and socio-economic risks for the aquaculture industry.

We examined the fate of Mediterranean seabass escapees following an escape event caused by sabotage in the Alboran Sea.

Escapee density decreased by 17% for every km away from the escape and fell to 2% and 1% after one and two months. 

The results can inform contingency plans and mitigate the socio-environmental risks associated with fish escape events.
