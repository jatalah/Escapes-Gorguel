An exception to the described escapee dispersal patterns was observed two months after the escape event (i.e., September), when densities at proximity sites (i.e., El Gorguel and Portman) were lower than in sites further away from the escape location, such as Atamaría, Calacortina or El Portús. This pattern could be explained by the higher post-escape fishing pressure experienced by proximity sites. Additionally, some distant sites have limited accessibility or are popular swimming spots where recreational fishing not allowed during summer. In most remote locations (i.e., Cabo de Palos and Azohía), fish densities were low or null because escapees could not reach those distances before being captured. 

Recapture
In addition, recapturing escaped seabass is more challenging than seabream because of their better swimming and dispersion abilities and more pelagic behaviour, which would hinder recapture by artisanal fisheries using bottom gillnets and trammel nets (Arechavala-Lopez et al. 2013c, Toledo‐Guedes et al. 2014).  

The increase in survival in the following sampling period (from 0.8 to 28.8% from August to September) may be due to the combination of three factors: the decrease in sport fishing pressure due to depletion of the resource, the cantonment of individuals in areas where the pressure fishing is "per se" low, and the adaptation to the environment (wildlife) of individuals survivors (Toledo-Guedes et al., 2014b).
